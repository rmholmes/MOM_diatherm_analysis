- Trying to run 025 ryf8485_KDS75 from Andy, but many errors related
  to python (payu) and others...

** 27-4-18:
Got MOM_Gyre idealized test case working, after fixing some errors
related to the incorrect version of input.nml being downloaded. See
below for progress.

Making progrem with 1deg_jra55_ryf9091_kds50 run -> replaced all input
files with the ones from 1deg_jra55_ryf/. Doesn't look like there is
anything serious changed, mainly the time step is different. Salinity
restoring looks the same. Didn't update namcouple, trying again...

Still having trouble with ryf8485_KDS75 from Andy -> Although this was
the payu error with prior_output_dir not found or something like that,
hopefully fixed now???

** 30-4-18:
1deg_jra55_ryf9091_kds50 run doesn't work because restarts have some
different settings (works from an initial condition). Try changing
these? 

Works if I change atmosphere/input_atm.nml, coupler/namcouple in the
restart folder to the new versions!! 

Started kds75, 100 and 135 runs for this. However, the kds100 is dying
with an out of range salinity error...

Giving up on 025_KDS75 for now...

** 1-5-18

Found out that the ACCESS-OM2 transports are all scaled differently,
fixed and rerunning FlI analysis.

** 1-6-18

Did another two years of the kb3seg runs with Eulerian vertical mixing
diagnostics for equatorial evaluation.

** 5-6-18

Updated MOM-SIS (software/MOM5) code to incorporate latest master
changes. Also updated my branches to create a pull request for
neutrho_temp changes for ACCESS-OM2. Also started a new
MOM_HeatDiag_kb3seg year run with this new executable (which includes
the change from neut_rho_is_temp to neutral_density_theta). Testing -
seems to check out. Problem with long runtimes seems to have been
temporary (latest run took 02:44).

Getting ACCESS-OM2 running: ------------------------------

Updated access-om2 code to latest. src/mom points to my latest
ryan/master (same as used for kb3seg above). This was done by updating
the outer repository and then individually updating all the submodules
(which are listed in .gitmodules) using e.g. "git submodule update
--init control/1deg_jra55_iaf". If I've made changes in these
submodules (e.g. changed exe paths in config.yaml) then had to revert
these first. For ones where i had changes I want to keep - switch back
to master branch in the submodule directory and update manually, then
merge these changes into my branch (e.g. diathermal in
1deg_jra55_ryf8485).

Copied across Kial's configs (*_may) and updated for diathermal
diagnostics. 

To get ACCESS-OM2 running/built:
export ACCESS_OM_DIR=$(pwd) (in access-om2 dir).
./install.sh

then change executable paths in config.yaml and do payu run (needed
payu/dev, which requires module use /projects/v45/modules).

Problems with input files: Went back to using full paths to input
files and executables in /short/public* (what is used in new
1deg_jra55_ryf), except for the ocean executable. Also needed to
changes accessom2.nml for a one-year runtime instead of 10!

Introduced error in vdiffuse_diff_cbt diagnostic - now fixed. 

** 20-6-18

Running ACCESS-OM2 with Kial's restarts and updated code
- Had problem with dt_ocean - need to remove from input.nml because of
  Nic's code changes.
- Also payu needs cice_in.nml from the old output folders, so needed
  to copy these from config into an empty archive/output***/ice/

Numerical mixing methods:
- Checked with new direct volume budget and gives almost the same as
  the old indirect method (small differences, presumably due to
  machine-precision, or loading/saving back into files etc.).
- However, new method from heat budget works much better!
- Is the binning of temp_flux_x_on_nrho correct??? Could this be even
  better? Have asked Steve.

** 21-6-18
On the binning on different grids:
- Currently tx_trans_nrho and ty_trans_nrho, located on ET and NT
  (east T-cell face and North T-cell face), are binned with the
  temperature on the T-cell center - so this is not completely
  accurate (see Steve's email). I've done the same for my heat fluxes
  on my first attempt.

Trying to fix this by introducing new Dens%neutralrho_et and
Dens%neutralrho_nt arrays which should be on the T-cell ET and T-cell
NT, and then bin with those. Testing now...

** 22-6-18

New T-cell binning seems to work slightly better (but I'm still not
doing the GM and submeso terms).

Now going to full T-cell edge binning, including GM and submeso terms
with new nrho_face_bin option. Testing.

Original T-cell center binning ndif_heat run:  output036_ndif_heat
T-cell edge binning of tx_trans and xflux (but not GM or submeso): output036_ndif_heat_transTedg
nrho_face_bin option: output036_ndif_heat_transTedgGMS

nrho_face_bin option doesn't seem to show any significant changes
relative to other, changes are restricted to interior of basins rather
than the WBCs. Keeping anyway

Production 10-year runs of the 1-degree configs all started
(KDS50,75,100,135 and GFDL50). 

** 27-6-18

New 5 years of MOM025_kb3seg run done with ndiff_heat diags on.

** 06-07-18

MOM_Gyre run with new heat budget method. Results are better, but
still weird, I don't know what is going on?

** 12-07-18
Found and fixed a bug with the kppbl diagnostic where it was not
initialized properly. All the plots in Diathermal_Paper were made
calculating kppbl by residual -> But the results are almost identical
now that the bug has been fixed.

** 23-07-18
Running another MOM01 run with heat budget numerical mixing diagnostics.

** 25-09-18

Back to heat function paper:

Significantly improved processing of ZAH code:
- Now doing the sum from cold->warm from beginning like analysis. 
- Introduced direct heat fluxes (temp_yflux_adv_on_nrho and
  temp_yflux_submeso_on_nrho) calculation of the full heat transport
  term A.
- Fixed latitude averaging/derivatives -> This was done incorrectly
  before because I hadn't realized that PSI was on yu points not yt
  points. Now it is done correctly (and using the latitude spacing of
  yu_ocean not yt_ocean (yuo not yto in processing code)).

Started another 4 years of kb3seg in order to do this calculation
properly over a four-year average.

** 28-03-19
Volume budget:
- Differences Access-om2 and MOM-SIS in ocean_sbc input.nml:
max_ice_thickness 1.0 vs 0.0
do_bitwise_exact_sum=.false. vs. .true.

options zero_net_water_coupler and zero_net_water_couple_restore are
active, meaning that the net water into the ocean from atmosphere +
land is kept mean zero, and that the net water into the ocean+ice is
zero (but water can be exchanged between the coean and ice).

Options to set components to zero (debug_water_fluxes)

Most of the eta_tend diagnostics are for non-Bous contributions
(e.g. covered by the diagnose_sea_level_forcing option)

Checks: 
- Global sum of (dzt*area) is 6e10m3 off from total_volume_seawater
- Global sum of mass_pmepr_on_nrho is ~1000m3/sec (~3000m3/sec for
  Chris) off from dVdt determined from dzt*area snapshots over a
  seasonal cycle.
- 

Try a new run with total_ocean_pme_river and total_volume_seawater snapshots


** 08-04-19 ACCESS-OM2-1 numerical mixing
Notes on ACCESS-OM2-1 budgets week of 5/4/19:
- ACCESS-OM2-1 uses conservative temperature, but the Cp is the same (we're not using TEOS10).
- Lat-temp: 
  - MDS and SIG drive meridional fluxes, so shouldn't really include them in vertical mixing.
  - Some big problem with numerical mixing, especially in the SO. What is going on here?

MOM Control numerical mixing:
- Should numerical mixing be zero integrated over a fluid column? ->
  It is not. Is this because of the volume budget issues? The net flux
  shows lots of small-scale zonal-striations -> associated with
  barotropic processes.
- Comparison of 3D numerical mixing using SUB-con vs. SUB-latflux:
  Overall they produce very similar results. The difference is nicely
  shown in the lat-temp plot and shows that overall the convergence
  method has slightly more up-gradient fluxes than the lateral-fluxes
  method. The difference has no net (all temps) flux. Taken literally,
  this difference is the (negative of the) numerical mixing due to the
  submesoscale scheme - which is dominantly negative as expected
  (although not required - there is likely some up-gradient fluxes
  because the implemetation is through skew-fluxes and might have
  problems?). 
- The 3D SUB-latflux and latT SUB-latflux calculations differ mainly
  through a net flux. This net flux is mostly (see line plot)
  explained by the fact that the budgets are done in the opposite
  direction (warm-to-cold vs. cold-to-warm). However, there is still
  some remaining mismatch - but it's small and noisy - likely machine
  precision or something?

Steve comments on global budgets:
- ascii should have the budgets to 12-significant digits
- netcdf may only save to 6-significant digits. So perhaps it's coming
  from this?

Namelist differences:
short/e14/rmh561/software/python/nmltab/nmltab.py -d ../../mom/MOM_HeatDiag_kb3seg/input.nml ../1deg_jra55_ryf8485_kds50_july/ocean/input.nml | less
- heaps to do with coupling
- ocean_barotropic: laplacian vs. biharmonic smoothing, bihgen friction
- ocean_frazil: Only top level in MOM-SIS
- friction differences
- mixdownslope
- cmip units
- nphysics
- overflow?
- river_diffuse_salt and river_diffuse_temp -> enhanced diffusion of
  temp and salt at rivers. This is added to diff_cbt (but not
  diagnosed separately in my kpp-diff diags).
- sigma-diff: On in access-om2-1 but in bottom cell only
- some different submesoscale options
- thickness dzt minimum

- ocean vert kpp mom4p1: kbl_standard_method: false in ACCESS-OM2-1 ->
  There is a warning in the code about negative mixing coefficients
  with this option
- smooth_blmc -> False in ACCESS-OM2-1
- smooth_ri_kmax_eq_kmu -> True in ACCESS_OM2-1
- ncar_ocean_flux
- raoult_sat_vap

ACCESS-OM2-1 vs. ACCESS-OM2-025 (gmredi):
- ocean_bih_tracer: tracer_mix_micom
- bihgen_friction and lapgen_friction
- mixdownslope (off in 025)
- overflow
- sigma

ACCESS-OM2-1 has much larger non-local KPP term, which is
up-gradient. This spatial pattern matches the numerical mixing
pattern - but so does all the other terms (e.g. vertical diffusion,
which seems to compensate with non-local KPP a lot).

Trying a run with smooth_blmc, kbl_standard_method and
smooth_ri_kmax.. all flipped back -> This did not change anything.

ACCESS-OM2-1 volume and salt budgets:
&ocean_sbc_nml
    runoff_salinity = 0.0 means that there should be no salt input from runoff.

Could the fact that the transport in ACCESS-OM2 is saved in units of
kg/s, vs. 10^9kg/s make a difference?

Almost there with the ACCESS-OM2-1 lat-temp plots -> Just missing some
linear-with-temperature mismatch/term.

- Trying a 1deg run with double temp res.

- Trying to get the 025_deg ACCESS-OM2 case going.

** 08-04-19 update
The Eulerian binned tendency term is seeing cooling from the sum of
the RHS diabatic terms at the warmest temperatures -> Mixing is strong
and surface forcing is cooling these waters. Everything else is pretty
small at the very warmest temperatures (e.g. advection, SUB/GM
etc.). Surface forcing is cooling these waters because the cooling by
sw_heat at the warmest temps seems to out do the warming by the total
vdiffuse_sbc (which is weak).

Reducing the time-step from 5400 to 1800s mostly removes this
issue. Perhaps it is fully removed at GFDL50? It also

* Diagnostics needed for various runs:
For global budget:
- temp, dzt from snapshots (end of month, end of year)
- mass_pmepr_on_nrho
- vdiffuse_diff_cbt, nonlocal_KPP, vdiffuse_sbc, sw_heat, frazil,
  eta_smooth, sfc_hflux_pme, rivermix
- vdiffuse_k33, neutral_diffusion
- mixdownslope

For latitude-temp budget:
- ty_trans_nrho, ty_trans_nrho_submeso
- yflux_adv_on_nrho, yflux_submeso_on_nrho
- ty_trans_nrho_gm
- yflux_gm_on_nrho

For 1-degree runs:
Total = 20. (360*180*50*20*8 = 0.5GB, but ACCESS_OM2 results would
suggest this is reduced to ~0.1GB by compression/missing
values). Taking 0.2GB => 20GB for 100 years

To reduce could combine:
F = vdiffuse_sbc + frazil + eta_smooth + sw_heat
P = hflux_pme + rivermix
M = vdiffuse_diff_cbt + nonlocal_KPP + mixdownslope
R = vdiffuse_k33 + neutral_diffusion
Reducing to 13.
Could also combine transports?, reducing to 9?

For spatially-resolved numerical mixing:
- tx_trans_nrho, tx_trans_nrho_submeso
- xflux_adv_on_nrho, xflux_submeso_on_nrho
- tx_trans_nrho_gm
- xflux_gm_on_nrho

For mixing components:
- kppiw, kppish, kppicon, kppbl, kppdd, wave, back?

Not used except for checks:
- advection, tendency, submesoscale, neutral_gm

* Idealized runs:

to set up gyre1 test case (MOM_Gyre) I did:

in software/MOM5/data/
./get_exp_data.py gyre1.input.tar.gz - but this didn't work! The path
is wrong, gives an old version of the input.nml. The correct version
is in the path in data/data_sources.csv, which is a source on raijin
ua8.

then moved all input files to new experiment folder
(rmh561/MOM_Gyre). Created a link to work and archive directories in
rmh561/mom, moved .nc input files to mom/input/gyre1 and moved all
input scripts (input.nml etc.) to experiment folder.

Started off with a 1800-day (5 year) spinup case with zstar
coordinates and minimal monthly output. Then will run my diathermal
diagnostics over the top (in diag_table_diathermal).

** 01-5-18

Base case run successfully, gives large numerical diffusion
particularly at the higher temps. Run for 12-months

Kicked off a high (5e-5) vertical diffusivity case.
